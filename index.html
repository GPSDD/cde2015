          The Global Goals Community Data Event is a gathering of policy makers, data scientists, issue area experts, entrepreneurs and business leaders, and last-mile users to discuss, plan, and build solutions that use data and public information to solve problems outlined in the Global Goals for Sustainable Development: www.GlobalGoals.org Participants will work together to develop potential solutions and paths forward to filling some of the most critical data gaps in measuring and achieving the goals.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Global Goals Community Data Event is the first of a series of gatherings that will take place across the globe to solve data gaps for the Global Goals, leading up to a summit on the Data Revolution planned for late Fall 2016.  <span style="font-weight: bold">We hope you will join us on September 18th and 19th</span> to help identify, build, and partner on long term solutions for a more just, equal, and empowered world.

              When multiple disciplines and sectors collaborate, insights emerge with the credibility to shift policies and actions on a large scale. The goals of this event include:
            </p>
            <p>
            ᐧ Demonstrate that utilizing diverse data sources and expertise can dramatically accelerate problem solving and increase the ability to address the gaps in data needed to measure and achieve the new goals
              <br>
               ᐧ Mobilize diverse participation and engagement, from senior policy leaders to data scientists and program leaders across multiple sectors<br>

               ᐧ Provide input to the priorities and plans of the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development Data<br>

               ᐧ Provide input to the launch event of the Global Partnership in late September immediately following the Head of State Summit where the new goals will be adopted by 193 heads of State<br>

               ᐧ Provide a pilot and lessons learned for future Partnership events
            </p>
            <p>
              The Global Partnership for the Sustainable Development Goals is an alliance of corporations, foundations, civil society organizations, non-profits, and governments that are working together to  draw on the wealth of information and data that is increasingly available and has the capacity to achieve Global Goals goals faster, more effectively, and with long-term impact.  We cannot do this alone.  There are thousands of people from all backgrounds and experiences that are already working to use and share information to shape a better world.  The Global Goals for Sustainable Development are setting an agenda to eliminate extreme poverty and continue the growth of a world with greater equality, individual agency, accountability, and collaboration across all peoples and sectors.  The Global Partnership seeks to elevate these voices and grow a broader community committed to working together in transparent and inclusive collaboration to solve these longstanding problems.
